When a user submits the form without entering any information, the application crashes instead of handling the case gracefully. This can be reliably reproduced by opening the app, navigating to the form page, and clicking the submit button without providing any input. From a user perspective, this is confusing and disruptive, as no feedback is shown before the application fails.

The expected behavior is for the form validation to catch missing required fields and display a clear, actionable error message. Users should be informed which fields need to be completed and be able to correct the issue without losing their progress. Instead, the current behavior results in a runtime exception that abruptly stops the application.

Initial investigation suggests that this issue was introduced during the recent refactor of the form validation logic. A required null or empty-state check may have been removed or altered, allowing invalid data to propagate further into the submission flow than intended. This indicates a potential gap in defensive checks or test coverage for empty input scenarios.

The problem occurs on the latest version of the application when running in Chrome on macOS, though it may not be limited to that environment. Fixing this issue would improve overall application stability and provide a more robust and user-friendly form submission experience, especially for first-time or less technical users.
